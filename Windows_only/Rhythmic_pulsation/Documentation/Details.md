## More details (Rhythmic pulsation)

### Adjustment note: 
LWKS-Kyframing should not be used with some parameters.  
E.g. A sliding change of the frames per cycle ("Main Interval") always shifts the position in the cycle, which can counteract the internally calculated positional change, which in the interplay will give a different cycle time than the Kyframe value.

### General note:
For cycle frames with decimal places, the cycle progress (and the marker) will occasionally pause for 2 frames at a position to remain synchronized with the set value.

#### More recent alternative effects:
Since Lightworks 14.5 it is possible for an effect to automatically determine the effect runtime. This is implemented in the Cyclic [Remote Control](https://www.lwks.com/index.php?option=com_kunena&func=view&catid=7&id=188603&Itemid=81#ftop). If you control a suitable zoom effect with this remote control, you can achieve the same result (and control even more effects if necessary).
