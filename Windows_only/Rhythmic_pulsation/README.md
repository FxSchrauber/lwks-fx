### Effect description:  The effect creates a cyclically repeating zoom. 
In addition to the frames per cycle, the zoom behavior within the cycles can also be set. For this purpose, the effect itself generates a curve graphic in order to be able to adjust the behavior more precisely. 
A prerequisite for the internal effect calculations is that you correctly set the effect runtime in frames in the effect.  
This Video shows how the timing of the effect can be adjusted exactly with the help of Cue in the timeline:

The effect also gives some feedback on the effect status and does some plausibility checks. The meaning of the warnings and confirmations is described in this PDF document:  
**[Meaning of displayed warning symbols][2]**  
Because the effect was developed for an older Lightworks version, it cannot be excluded that individual warnings react differently than documented.
