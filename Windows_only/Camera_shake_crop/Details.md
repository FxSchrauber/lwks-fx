    - **Mirrored edges (no zoom)**  
      Details in progress  
    - **Zoom; mirrored edges visible**

  - **XY Shake ratio**  
    - 0% = Statistically identical average intensity of horizontal and vertical movements.
    - -100% = Horizontal movements only.
    - +100% = Vertical movements only.

#### Random values
They are not real random values.  
From this ramp, the effect creates seemingly random values to produce the shaking.
![](IMG/Random.jpg)  
The values of this ramp itself are **not** the random values, but merely the basis for selecting an internal random value.
If you want to start the effect with other shaking behaviors then you can change the starting value of the keyframing (ramp). 
Note that the angle of the ramp also affects the speed. If you just want to change the speed then use the "Speed" slider.
