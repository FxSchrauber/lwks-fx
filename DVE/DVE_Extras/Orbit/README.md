### Known issues and limitations:
- With negative zoom (minimization),the default setting Orbit Radius refers to the outer edges of the foreground. This ensures that zooming in does not affect the visibility of the foreground object. The side effect is that at 0% zoom, no position change takes place.  
- Crop: In case of asymmetrical cropping, the spin center is not centered correctly.

### Effect description: Currently under construction
The `Rounds` slider lets the minimized foreground texture circle around the set `Effect center` (only 2D).  
`Spin` enables a self-rotation of the foreground.
